      <h3>SCHOOL RULES & REGULATIONS</h3>
      <p>
        Below are reviewed school rules of Ngami Sec School. The list is not
        exhaustive as some rules require one to use his common sense. Over and
        above what is written, the student of this school is supposed to be
        decent in dressing and language, have initiative and be hard working in
        and out class. One should think independently using the teacher as
        consultant and guide.
      </p>
      <h5>Importance of School Rules</h5>
      <p>
        School rules are established to maintain peace and order among members
        of the school community. Obviously, not everyone will be satisfied with
        all the rules. Problems are solved through dialogue and compromise. If a
        student has a problem/complaint to make, he should first report to the
        immediate person responsible for the affected area of school life. If he
        is not satisfied with the outcome, one should report to the immediate
        higher level, until he reaches the principal.
        <br />
        If dissatisfied with the principal's solution, there are two options:
        either to remain at Ngami secondary School and follow the rules as
        required even though they are not pleased with some aspects of school
        life; or choose to go away and join another school where their needs may
        be better met.
        <br /> Through the School rules and proper guidance from teachers'
        adults and parents, after School students will be expected to adapt well
        and follow the law of the land.
