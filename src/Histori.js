      <h3>Institution History</h3>
      <p>
        Ngami was established in 1981.It was an initiative by the local
        community to cater for the education of the local girls and boys who
        could not join the then provincial and national schools in the country.
        By then it was a harambee secondary school sponsored by The Catholic
        Archdiocese of Mombasa, Kenya. The school suffered from staffing
        problems and low enrolment as very few members of the community had
        quietly accepted it as an adequate secondary school. The school, after
        undergoing several hurdles, was taken over by the government and was
        categorized as a district school. This enabled the posting of teachers
        by the government thus easing the staffing hiccups. Ngami Secondary
        School is a day/boarding, girls/boysâ€™ school that is currently offering
        the 8-4-4 curriculum which has been the Kenyan system of education since
        1985. This school has produced men and women of great academic
        experience and has nurtured talents too. To date, the school has served
        over 3200 students since its inception who have served in both academics
        and co-curricular activities. The different co-curricular activities
        offered range from basketball boys, volleyball boys and girls, netball
        girls, football boys, drama and many others. In the year 2016 and 2017,
        the school volleyball boys team progressed to the regional level
        bringing back home a wonderful trophy, while the drama troupe as well
        reached the regional level. The music group represented the school at
        the National level. The school enrolment has grown over time and
        currently is about 514 students, a triple streamed school.
