        <li>Human Resource</li>
        <p>
          Ngami secondary school is served both by teams of teaching and
          non-teaching staff. The teaching staff comprises of 26 teachers ,19 of
          which are employed by the government while 7 are employed by B.O.M.
          The staff is almost at 80% male and 20% female . The following are
          academic departments: languages, Science, Mathematics, Humanities and
          Technical and Applied department. There are teachers also in charge of
          non-academic department as games, guidance and counselling and
          boarding. The teaching staff is inadequate as some teachers have a
          very high teaching load of over 28 lessons in a week. The school is
          also served by a team of non-teaching staff who serve in several
          departments ranging from the accounts, kitchen, security and others
          who serve as secretary, laboratory technician and the office
          messenger. The school has not yet achieved 100% gender parity in its
          non-teaching staff as there are 8 males and 7 females. At the security
          department there are four males and 1 lady, kitchen 3 males and 1
          female and the accounts clerk is also a male. While the female staff
          is distributed as follows; one matron, one cook, a laboratory
          technician a secretary and an office messenger. The non-teaching staff
          is inadequate because a school of this caliber ought to employ a
          grounds man and a school nurse as there are about 323 students who are
          boarders but the scarcity of resources cannot allow it.

        <p>
          The school is partly funded by the government and also there are

          operations, tuition and boarding, Equipment and Stores (BES).
          Currently, parents also pay levies to the school that help pay the
          B.O.M teachers and also run the school lunch program. The school
          finances run through the following system of income and expenditure as
          in the example give of the year 2022. The school has no other sources
