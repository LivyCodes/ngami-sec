        novels, journals, and reference materials. The books cover various
        subjects, including science, mathematics, literature, history, and many
        others. Students can use the library to supplement their classroom
        learning by accessing books that provide further explanations of the
        topics covered in class.

        understanding of different subjects.

        The library also provides a quiet and comfortable space for students to
        study. The library has tables and chairs where students can sit and
        study without distractions. The peaceful environment in the library
        enables students to concentrate on their studies and make the most of
        their time.

        school encourages students to read for pleasure, and the library has a
        collection of novels and other literature that students can borrow and
